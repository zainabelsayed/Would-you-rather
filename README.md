## Would You Rather?
Would You Rather project is a web app that  lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

users able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

## How it works?
download the project or clone it from `https://github.com/zainabelsayed/Would-you-rather.git` then write `npm install` then `npm start`
it should open the `localhost:3000` and you can start the game
